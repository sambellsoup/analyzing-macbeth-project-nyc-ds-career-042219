    "## Getting the Data\n",
    "Here we start by importing a python package and using it to pull the transcript of Macbeth from the project Gutenberg website. We also preview a few details about what is now stored in the variable macbeth; it's a string with 119,846 characters, the first 500 of which are printed below. "

    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words in Shakespeare's Macbeth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A common python programming pattern to counting objects, produce histograms, or update statistics is to make calls to a dictionary as you iterate through a list. For example, given a list of words, you can create a dictionary to store counts and then iterate through the list of words, checking how many times each word has appeared using your dictionary, and updating the dictionary count now that you've seen that word again. The `dictionary.get()` method is very useful in doing this. Read the docstring for the dictionary.get() method and use it along with the pseudocode above to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words from the transcript of Macbeth which has been loaded into a variable 'Macbeth'. Be sure to include a title and appropriate labels for your graph."

Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any\\r\\nof these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\\r\\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\\r\\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\\r\\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\\r\\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.

Since our ftp program has\\r\\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\\r\\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\\r\\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\\r\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\r\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\\r\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\\r\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\r\\nfrom Michael Hart\\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\r\\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\r\\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\\r\\ndon\\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\r\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Who\\'s there?\\r\\n  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold\\r\\nyour selfe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bar. Long liue the King\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\r\\nor letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the\\r\\noriginal meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\r\\nto unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\\r\\nthat look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\r\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\\r\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a\\r\\ntime when they were out of \"v\"\\'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in\\r\\nplace of some \"w\"\\'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,\\r\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn\\'t want to spend\\r\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I\\r\\nhave mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an\\r\\nextreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\r\\nvery high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\r\\nassortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University\\r\\nin England for several months in a glass room constructed for the\\r\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available\\r\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\\r\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\\r\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\r\\nfor signing his name with several different spellings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, please take this into account when reading the comments below\\r\\nmade by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\r\\nthat are \"not\" errors. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\r\\nhere is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare\\'s The Tragedie\\r\\nof Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael S. Hart\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\r\\nExecutive Director\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScanner\\'s Notes: What this is and isn\\'t.  This was taken from\\r\\na copy of Shakespeare\\'s first folio and it is as close as I can\\r\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elongated S\\'s have been changed to small s\\'s and the\\r\\nconjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\r\\npunctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\\r\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put\\r\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\\r\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare\\'s First Folio and have unified\\r\\nspellings according to this template), typo\\'s and expanded\\r\\nabbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within\\r\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don\\'t like that\\r\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\\r\\npurer Shakespeare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\\r\\ndifferences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may\\r\\nbe differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between\\r\\nthis and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer\\'s\\r\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and\\r\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then\\r\\ncontinuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn\\'t thrown away but\\r\\nincorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\\r\\nThe text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different\\r\\nFirst Folio editions\\' best pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\r\\nerrors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\r\\nfree to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best\\r\\netext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com\\r\\nand davidr@inconnect.com.

So I lose none,\\r\\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keepe\\r\\nMy Bosome franchis\\'d, and Allegeance cleare,\\r\\nI shall be counsail\\'d\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Good repose the while\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. Thankes Sir: the like to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Banquo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Goe bid thy Mistresse, when my drinke is ready,\\r\\nShe strike vpon the Bell. Get thee to bed.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this a Dagger, which I see before me,\\r\\nThe Handle toward my Hand? Come, let me clutch thee:\\r\\nI haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.\\r\\nArt thou not fatall Vision, sensible\\r\\nTo feeling, as to sight? or art thou but\\r\\nA Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,\\r\\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?\\r\\nI see thee yet, in forme as palpable,\\r\\nAs this which now I draw.\\r\\nThou marshall\\'st me the way that I was going,\\r\\nAnd such an Instrument I was to vse.\\r\\nMine Eyes are made the fooles o\\'th\\' other Sences,\\r\\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\\r\\nAnd on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,\\r\\nWhich was not so before. There\\'s no such thing:\\r\\nIt is the bloody Businesse, which informes\\r\\nThus to mine Eyes. Now o\\'re the one halfe World\\r\\nNature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse\\r\\nThe Curtain\\'d sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates\\r\\nPale Heccats Offrings: and wither\\'d Murther,\\r\\nAlarum\\'d by his Centinell, the Wolfe,\\r\\nWhose howle\\'s his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\\r\\nWith Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe\\r\\nMoues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth\\r\\nHeare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare\\r\\nThy very stones prate of my where-about,\\r\\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\\r\\nWhich now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:\\r\\nWords to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Bell rings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.\\r\\nHeare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,\\r\\nThat summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Secunda.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n  La. That which hath made the[m] drunk, hath made me bold:\\r\\nWhat hath quench\\'d them, hath giuen me fire.\\r\\nHearke, peace: it was the Owle that shriek\\'d,\\r\\nThe fatall Bell-man, which giues the stern\\'st good-night.\\r\\nHe is about it, the Doores are open:\\r\\nAnd the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge\\r\\nWith Snores. I haue drugg\\'d their Possets,\\r\\nThat Death and Nature doe contend about them,\\r\\nWhether they liue, or dye.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Who\\'s there? what hoa?\\r\\n  Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak\\'d,\\r\\nAnd \\'tis not done: th\\' attempt, and not the deed,\\r\\nConfounds vs: hearke: I lay\\'d their Daggers ready,\\r\\nHe could not misse \\'em. Had he not resembled\\r\\nMy Father as he slept, I had don\\'t.\\r\\nMy Husband?\\r\\n  Macb. I haue done the deed:\\r\\nDidst thou not heare a noyse?\\r\\n  Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets cry.\\r\\nDid not you speake?\\r\\n  Macb. When?\\r\\n  Lady. Now\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. As I descended?\\r\\n  Lady. I\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Hearke, who lyes i\\'th\\' second Chamber?\\r\\n  Lady. Donalbaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. This is a sorry sight\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. There\\'s one did laugh in\\'s sleepe,\\r\\nAnd one cry\\'d Murther, that they did wake each other:\\r\\nI stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,\\r\\nAnd addrest them againe to sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. There are two lodg\\'d together\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. One cry\\'d God blesse vs, and Amen the other,\\r\\nAs they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:\\r\\nListning their feare, I could not say Amen,\\r\\nWhen they did say God blesse vs\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Consider it not so deepely\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?\\r\\nI had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. These deeds must not be thought\\r\\nAfter these wayes: so, it will make vs mad\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:\\r\\nMacbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,\\r\\nSleepe that knits vp the rauel\\'d Sleeue of Care,\\r\\nThe death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,\\r\\nBalme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,\\r\\nChiefe nourisher in Life\\'s Feast\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. What doe you meane?\\r\\n  Macb. Still it cry\\'d, Sleepe no more to all the House:\\r\\nGlamis hath murther\\'d Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor\\r\\nShall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Who was it, that thus cry\\'d? why worthy Thane,\\r\\nYou doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke\\r\\nSo braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,\\r\\nAnd wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.\\r\\nWhy did you bring these Daggers from the place?\\r\\nThey must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare\\r\\nThe sleepie Groomes with blood\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Ile goe no more:\\r\\nI am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:\\r\\nLooke on\\'t againe, I dare not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Infirme of purpose:\\r\\nGiue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,\\r\\nAre but as Pictures: \\'tis the Eye of Childhood,\\r\\nThat feares a painted Deuill. If he doe bleed,\\r\\nIle guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,\\r\\nFor it must seeme their Guilt.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnocke within.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Whence is that knocking?\\r\\nHow is\\'t with me, when euery noyse appalls me?\\r\\nWhat Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.\\r\\nWill all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood\\r\\nCleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather\\r\\nThe multitudinous Seas incarnardine,\\r\\nMaking the Greene one, Red.\\r\\nEnter Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. My Hands are of your colour: but I shame\\r\\nTo weare a Heart so white.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnocke.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heare a knocking at the South entry:\\r\\nRetyre we to our Chamber:\\r\\nA little Water cleares vs of this deed.\\r\\nHow easie is it then? your Constancie\\r\\nHath left you vnattended.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnocke.\\r\\n\\r\\nHearke, more knocking.\\r\\nGet on your Night-Gowne, least occasion call vs,\\r\\nAnd shew vs to be Watchers: be not lost\\r\\nSo poorely in your thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. To know my deed,\\r\\n\\r\\nKnocke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Twere best not know my selfe.\\r\\nWake Duncan with thy knocking:\\r\\nI would thou could\\'st.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Tertia.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a Porter.

Who\\'s there\\r\\ni\\'th\\' name of Belzebub? Here\\'s a Farmer, that hang\\'d\\r\\nhimselfe on th\\' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue\\r\\nNapkins enow about you, here you\\'le sweat for\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock, knock. Who\\'s there in th\\' other Deuils Name?\\r\\nFaith here\\'s an Equiuocator, that could sweare in both\\r\\nthe Scales against eyther Scale, who committed Treason\\r\\nenough for Gods sake, yet could not equiuocate to Heauen:\\r\\noh come in, Equiuocator.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock, Knock, Knock. Who\\'s there? \\'Faith here\\'s an English\\r\\nTaylor come hither, for stealing out of a French Hose:\\r\\nCome in Taylor, here you may rost your Goose.\\r\\nKnock.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock, Knock. Neuer at quiet: What are you? but this\\r\\nplace is too cold for Hell. Ile Deuill-Porter it no further:\\r\\nI had thought to haue let in some of all Professions, that\\r\\ngoe the Primrose way to th\\' euerlasting Bonfire.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnon, anon, I pray you remember the Porter.\\r\\nEnter Macduff, and Lenox.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macd. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to Bed,\\r\\nThat you doe lye so late?\\r\\n  Port. Faith Sir, we were carowsing till the second Cock:\\r\\nAnd Drinke, Sir, is a great prouoker of three things\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What three things does Drinke especially\\r\\nprouoke?\\r\\n  Port. Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.\\r\\nLecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes\\r\\nthe desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore\\r\\nmuch Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:\\r\\nit makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,\\r\\nand it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens\\r\\nhim; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,\\r\\nequiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,\\r\\nleaues him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night\\r\\n\\r\\n   Port. That it did, Sir, i\\'the very Throat on me: but I\\r\\nrequited him for his Lye, and (I thinke) being too strong\\r\\nfor him, though he tooke vp my Legges sometime, yet I\\r\\nmade a Shift to cast him.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macd. Is thy Master stirring?\\r\\nOur knocking ha\\'s awak\\'d him: here he comes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. Good morrow, Noble Sir\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Good morrow both\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?\\r\\n  Macb. Not yet\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He did command me to call timely on him,\\r\\nI haue almost slipt the houre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Ile bring you to him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you:\\r\\nBut yet \\'tis one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb.

Goes the King hence to day?\\r\\n  Macb. He does: he did appoint so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. The Night ha\\'s been vnruly:\\r\\nWhere we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,\\r\\nAnd (as they say) lamentings heard i\\'th\\' Ayre;\\r\\nStrange Schreemes of Death,\\r\\nAnd Prophecying, with Accents terrible,\\r\\nOf dyre Combustion, and confus\\'d Euents,\\r\\nNew hatch\\'d toth\\' wofull time.\\r\\nThe obscure Bird clamor\\'d the liue-long Night.\\r\\nSome say, the Earth was Feuorous,\\r\\nAnd did shake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. \\'Twas a rough Night\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. My young remembrance cannot paralell\\r\\nA fellow to it.\\r\\nEnter Macduff.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macd. O horror, horror, horror,\\r\\nTongue nor Heart cannot conceiue, nor name thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. and Lenox. What\\'s the matter?\\r\\n  Macd. Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:\\r\\nMost sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope\\r\\nThe Lords anoynted Temple, and stole thence\\r\\nThe Life o\\'th\\' Building\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. What is\\'t you say, the Life?\\r\\n  Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?\\r\\n  Macd. Approch the Chamber, and destroy your sight\\r\\nWith a new Gorgon. Doe not bid me speake:\\r\\nSee, and then speake your selues: awake, awake,\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt. Macbeth and Lenox.\\r\\n\\r\\nRing the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,\\r\\nBanquo, and Donalbaine: Malcolme awake,\\r\\nShake off this Downey sleepe, Deaths counterfeit,\\r\\nAnd looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see\\r\\nThe great Doomes Image: Malcolme, Banquo,\\r\\nAs from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,\\r\\nTo countenance this horror.

Woe, alas:\\r\\nWhat, in our House?\\r\\n  Ban. Too cruell, any where.\\r\\nDeare Duff, I prythee contradict thy selfe,\\r\\nAnd say, it is not so.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Had I but dy\\'d an houre before this chance,\\r\\nI had liu\\'d a blessed time: for from this instant,\\r\\nThere\\'s nothing serious in Mortalitie:\\r\\nAll is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,\\r\\nThe Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees\\r\\nIs left this Vault, to brag of.\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Donalbaine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Donal. What is amisse?\\r\\n  Macb. You are, and doe not know\\'t:\\r\\nThe Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood\\r\\nIs stopt, the very Source of it is stopt\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Your Royall Father\\'s murther\\'d\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Oh, by whom?\\r\\n  Lenox. Those of his Chamber, as it seem\\'d, had don\\'t:\\r\\nTheir Hands and Faces were all badg\\'d with blood,\\r\\nSo were their Daggers, which vnwip\\'d, we found\\r\\nVpon their Pillowes: they star\\'d, and were distracted,\\r\\nNo mans Life was to be trusted with them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,\\r\\nThat I did kill them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Wherefore did you so?\\r\\n  Macb. Who can be wise, amaz\\'d, temp\\'rate, & furious,\\r\\nLoyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:\\r\\nTh\\' expedition of my violent Loue\\r\\nOut-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,\\r\\nHis Siluer skinne, lac\\'d with His Golden Blood,\\r\\nAnd his gash\\'d Stabs, look\\'d like a Breach in Nature,\\r\\nFor Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,\\r\\nSteep\\'d in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers\\r\\nVnmannerly breech\\'d with gore: who could refraine,\\r\\nThat had a heart to loue; and in that heart,\\r\\nCourage, to make\\'s loue knowne?\\r\\n  Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Looke to the Lady\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,\\r\\nThat most may clayme this argument for ours?\\r\\n  Donal.

Nor our strong Sorrow\\r\\nVpon the foot of Motion\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. Looke to the Lady:\\r\\nAnd when we haue our naked Frailties hid,\\r\\nThat suffer in exposure; let vs meet,\\r\\nAnd question this most bloody piece of worke,\\r\\nTo know it further.

Ha, good Father,\\r\\nThou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,\\r\\nThreatens his bloody Stage: byth\\' Clock \\'tis Day,\\r\\nAnd yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:\\r\\nIs\\'t Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,\\r\\nThat Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,\\r\\nWhen liuing Light should kisse it?\\r\\n  Old man. \\'Tis vnnaturall,\\r\\nEuen like the deed that\\'s done: On Tuesday last,\\r\\nA Faulcon towring in her pride of place,\\r\\nWas by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill\\'d\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. And Duncans Horses,\\r\\n(A thing most strange, and certaine)\\r\\nBeauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,\\r\\nTurn\\'d wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,\\r\\nContending \\'gainst Obedience, as they would\\r\\nMake Warre with Mankinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Old man. \\'Tis said, they eate each other\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse.

Why see you not?\\r\\n  Ross. Is\\'t known who did this more then bloody deed?\\r\\n  Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ross. Alas the day,\\r\\nWhat good could they pretend?\\r\\n  Macd. They were subborned,\\r\\nMalcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes\\r\\nAre stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them\\r\\nSuspition of the deed\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. \\'Gainst Nature still,\\r\\nThriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp\\r\\nThine owne liues meanes: Then \\'tis most like,\\r\\nThe Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd.

If there come truth from them,\\r\\nAs vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,\\r\\nWhy by the verities on thee made good,\\r\\nMay they not be my Oracles as well,\\r\\nAnd set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords,\\r\\nand\\r\\nAttendants.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Heere\\'s our chiefe Guest\\r\\n\\r\\n   La.

There is none but he,\\r\\nWhose being I doe feare: and vnder him,\\r\\nMy Genius is rebuk\\'d, as it is said\\r\\nMark Anthonies was by Caesar.

I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that\\r\\nWhich might appall the Diuell\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. O proper stuffe:\\r\\nThis is the very painting of your feare:\\r\\nThis is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said\\r\\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flawes and starts\\r\\n(Impostors to true feare) would well become\\r\\nA womans story, at a Winters fire\\r\\nAuthoriz\\'d by her Grandam: shame it selfe,\\r\\nWhy do you make such faces?

Blood hath bene shed ere now, i\\'th\\' olden time\\r\\nEre humane Statute purg\\'d the gentle Weale:\\r\\nI, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform\\'d\\r\\nToo terrible for the eare. The times has bene,\\r\\nThat when the Braines were out, the man would dye,\\r\\nAnd there an end: But now they rise againe\\r\\nWith twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,\\r\\nAnd push vs from our stooles.

Or be aliue againe,\\r\\nAnd dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:\\r\\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest mee\\r\\nThe Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,\\r\\nVnreall mock\\'ry hence. Why so, being gone\\r\\nI am a man againe: pray you sit still\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. You haue displac\\'d the mirth,\\r\\nBroke the good meeting, with most admir\\'d disorder\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb.

My former Speeches,\\r\\nHaue but hit your Thoughts\\r\\nWhich can interpret farther: Onely I say\\r\\nThings haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\\r\\nWas pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:\\r\\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk\\'d too late,\\r\\nWhom you may say (if\\'t please you) Fleans kill\\'d,\\r\\nFor Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.\\r\\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\\r\\nIt was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane\\r\\nTo kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,\\r\\nHow it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight\\r\\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents teare,\\r\\nThat were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?\\r\\nWas not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:\\r\\nFor \\'twould haue anger\\'d any heart aliue\\r\\nTo heare the men deny\\'t. So that I say,\\r\\nHe ha\\'s borne all things well, and I do thinke,\\r\\nThat had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,\\r\\n(As, and\\'t please Heauen he shall not) they should finde\\r\\nWhat \\'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.\\r\\nBut peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl\\'d\\r\\nHis presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare\\r\\nMacduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\\r\\nWhere he bestowes himselfe?\\r\\n  Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane\\r\\n(From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)\\r\\nLiues in the English Court, and is receyu\\'d\\r\\nOf the most Pious Edward, with such grace,\\r\\nThat the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing\\r\\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe\\r\\nIs gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd\\r\\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,\\r\\nThat by the helpe of these (with him aboue)\\r\\nTo ratifie the Worke) we may againe\\r\\nGiue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:\\r\\nFree from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;\\r\\nDo faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,\\r\\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\\r\\nHath so exasperate their King, that hee\\r\\nPrepares for some attempt of Warre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Len. Sent he to Macduffe?\\r\\n  Lord.

I coniure you, by that which you Professe,\\r\\n(How ere you come to know it) answer me:\\r\\nThough you vntye the Windes, and let them fight\\r\\nAgainst the Churches: Though the yesty Waues\\r\\nConfound and swallow Nauigation vp:\\r\\nThough bladed Corne be lodg\\'d, & Trees blown downe,\\r\\nThough Castles topple on their Warders heads:\\r\\nThough Pallaces, and Pyramids do slope\\r\\nTheir heads to their Foundations: Though the treasure\\r\\nOf Natures Germaine, tumble altogether,\\r\\nEuen till destruction sicken: Answer me\\r\\nTo what I aske you\\r\\n\\r\\n   1 Speake\\r\\n\\r\\n   2 Demand\\r\\n\\r\\n   3 Wee\\'l answer\\r\\n\\r\\n   1 Say, if th\\'hadst rather heare it from our mouthes,\\r\\nOr from our Masters\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Call \\'em: let me see \\'em\\r\\n\\r\\n   1 Powre in Sowes blood, that hath eaten\\r\\nHer nine Farrow: Greaze that\\'s sweaten\\r\\nFrom the Murderers Gibbet, throw\\r\\nInto the Flame\\r\\n\\r\\n   All. Come high or low:\\r\\nThy Selfe and Office deaftly show.\\r\\nThunder. 1. Apparation, an Armed Head.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Tell me, thou vnknowne power\\r\\n\\r\\n   1 He knowes thy thought:\\r\\nHeare his speech, but say thou nought\\r\\n\\r\\n   1 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth:\\r\\nBeware Macduffe,\\r\\nBeware the Thane of Fife: dismisse me. Enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe Descends.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. What ere thou art, for thy good caution, thanks\\r\\nThou hast harp\\'d my feare aright. But one word more\\r\\n\\r\\n   1 He will not be commanded: heere\\'s another\\r\\nMore potent then the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder. 2 Apparition, a Bloody Childe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  2 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Had I three eares, Il\\'d heare thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Appar. Be bloody, bold, & resolute:\\r\\nLaugh to scorne\\r\\nThe powre of man: For none of woman borne\\r\\nShall harme Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescends.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mac. Then liue Macduffe: what need I feare of thee?\\r\\nBut yet Ile make assurance: double sure,\\r\\nAnd take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,\\r\\nThat I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;\\r\\nAnd sleepe in spight of Thunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder 3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is this, that rises like the issue of a King,\\r\\nAnd weares vpon his Baby-brow, the round\\r\\nAnd top of Soueraignty?\\r\\n  All. Listen, but speake not too\\'t\\r\\n\\r\\n   3 Appar. Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:\\r\\nWho chafes, who frets, or where Conspirers are:\\r\\nMacbeth shall neuer vanquish\\'d be, vntill\\r\\nGreat Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill\\r\\nShall come against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescend.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. That will neuer bee:\\r\\nWho can impresse the Forrest, bid the Tree\\r\\nVnfixe his earth-bound Root? Sweet boadments, good:\\r\\nRebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood\\r\\nOf Byrnan rise, and our high plac\\'d Macbeth\\r\\nShall liue the Lease of Nature, pay his breath\\r\\nTo time, and mortall Custome. Yet my Hart\\r\\nThrobs to know one thing: Tell me, if your Art\\r\\nCan tell so much: Shall Banquo\\'s issue euer\\r\\nReigne in this Kingdome?\\r\\n  All. Seeke to know no more\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I will be satisfied. Deny me this,\\r\\nAnd an eternall Curse fall on you: Let me know.\\r\\nWhy sinkes that Caldron? & what noise is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nHoboyes\\r\\n\\r\\n  1 Shew\\r\\n\\r\\n   2 Shew\\r\\n\\r\\n   3 Shew\\r\\n\\r\\n   All. Shew his Eyes, and greeue his Hart,\\r\\nCome like shadowes, so depart.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shew of eight Kings, and Banquo last, with a glasse in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:\\r\\nThy Crowne do\\'s seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire\\r\\nThou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:\\r\\nA third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,\\r\\nWhy do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!\\r\\nWhat will the Line stretch out to\\'th\\' cracke of Doome?\\r\\nAnother yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:\\r\\nAnd yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,\\r\\nWhich shewes me many more: and some I see,\\r\\nThat two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.\\r\\nHorrible sight: Now I see \\'tis true,\\r\\nFor the Blood-bolter\\'d Banquo smiles vpon me,\\r\\nAnd points at them for his. What? is this so?\\r\\n  1 I Sir, all this is so. But why\\r\\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?\\r\\nCome Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,\\r\\nAnd shew the best of our delights.\\r\\nIle Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,\\r\\nWhile you performe your Antique round:\\r\\nThat this great King may kindly say,\\r\\nOur duties, did his welcome pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusicke. The Witches Dance, and vanish.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Where are they? Gone?\\r\\nLet this pernitious houre,\\r\\nStand aye accursed in the Kalender.\\r\\nCome in, without there.\\r\\nEnter Lenox.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lenox. What\\'s your Graces will\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Saw you the Weyard Sisters?\\r\\n  Lenox. No my Lord\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Came they not by you?\\r\\n  Lenox. No indeed my Lord\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Infected be the Ayre whereon they ride,\\r\\nAnd damn\\'d all those that trust them. I did heare\\r\\nThe gallopping of Horse. Who was\\'t came by?\\r\\n  Len. \\'Tis two or three my Lord, that bring you word:\\r\\nMacduff is fled to England\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Fled to England?\\r\\n  Len. I, my good Lord\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Time, thou anticipat\\'st my dread exploits:\\r\\nThe flighty purpose neuer is o\\'re-tooke\\r\\nVnlesse the deed go with it. From this moment,\\r\\nThe very firstlings of my heart shall be\\r\\nThe firstlings of my hand. And euen now\\r\\nTo Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:\\r\\nThe Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.\\r\\nSeize vpon Fife; giue to th\\' edge o\\'th\\' Sword\\r\\nHis Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules\\r\\nThat trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,\\r\\nThis deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,\\r\\nBut no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?\\r\\nCome bring me where they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Secunda.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?\\r\\n  Rosse. You must haue patience Madam\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. He had none:\\r\\nHis flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,\\r\\nOur feares do make vs Traitors\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. You know not\\r\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\r\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\r\\nFrom whence himselfe do\\'s flye? He loues vs not,\\r\\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\r\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\\r\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\r\\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\\r\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\r\\nSo runnes against all reason\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\r\\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\r\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\\r\\nThe fits o\\'th\\' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\r\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\r\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\r\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\r\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\r\\nEach way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:\\r\\nShall not be long but Ile be heere againe:\\r\\nThings at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,\\r\\nTo what they were before. My pretty Cosine,\\r\\nBlessing vpon you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Father\\'d he is,\\r\\nAnd yet hee\\'s Father-lesse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay longer\\r\\nIt would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.\\r\\nI take my leaue at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,\\r\\nAnd what will you do now? How will you liue?\\r\\n  Son. As Birds do Mother\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?\\r\\n  Son. With what I get I meane, and so do they\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore Bird,\\r\\nThou\\'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,\\r\\nThe Pitfall, nor the Gin\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Why should I Mother?\\r\\nPoore Birds they are not set for:\\r\\nMy Father is not dead for all your saying\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Yes, he is dead:\\r\\nHow wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. Nay how will you do for a Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then you\\'l by \\'em to sell againe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Thou speak\\'st withall thy wit,\\r\\nAnd yet I\\'faith with wit enough for thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\r\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\\r\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Euery one that do\\'s so, is a Traitor,\\r\\nAnd must be hang\\'d\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And must they all be hang\\'d, that swear and lye?\\r\\n  Wife. Euery one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\r\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\r\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\r\\nand hang vp them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\r\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl\\'d weepe for him: if you\\r\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\r\\nhaue a new Father\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk\\'st?\\r\\nEnter a Messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,\\r\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\r\\nI doubt some danger do\\'s approach you neerely.\\r\\nIf you will take a homely mans aduice,\\r\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\r\\nTo fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\\r\\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\\r\\nWhich is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\\r\\nI dare abide no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Messenger\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\\r\\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\\r\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\r\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\r\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\r\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\r\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\r\\nWhat are these faces?\\r\\nEnter Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\r\\nWhere such as thou may\\'st finde him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. He\\'s a Traitor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Thou ly\\'st thou shagge-ear\\'d Villaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. What you Egge?\\r\\nYong fry of Treachery?\\r\\n  Son. He ha\\'s kill\\'d me Mother,\\r\\nRun away I pray you.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit crying Murther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScaena Tertia.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\r\\nWeepe our sad bosomes empty\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\r\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\\r\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\r\\nNew Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\r\\nStrike heauen on the face, that it resounds\\r\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell\\'d out\\r\\nLike Syllable of Dolour\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\r\\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\r\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\r\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\r\\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\r\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou\\'d him well,\\r\\nHe hath not touch\\'d you yet. I am yong, but something\\r\\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\r\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\r\\nT\\' appease an angry God\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\r\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\r\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\r\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\r\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\r\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\r\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\r\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\r\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\r\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\r\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\r\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\r\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\r\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\r\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\r\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\r\\nThe Title, is affear\\'d. Far thee well Lord,\\r\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think\\'st,\\r\\nFor the whole Space that\\'s in the Tyrants Graspe,\\r\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\r\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\r\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\r\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\r\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\r\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\r\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\r\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\r\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\r\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\r\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\r\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\r\\nBy him that shall succeede\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\r\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\r\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\r\\nThat when they shall be open\\'d, blacke Macbeth\\r\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\r\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar\\'d\\r\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\r\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn\\'d\\r\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\r\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\r\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\r\\nThat ha\\'s a name. But there\\'s no bottome, none\\r\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\r\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\r\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\r\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\r\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\r\\nThen such an one to reigne\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\r\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\r\\nTh\\' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\r\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\r\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\r\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\r\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\r\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\r\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\r\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\r\\nFinding it so inclinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\r\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\r\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\r\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\r\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\r\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\r\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\r\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\r\\nDestroying them for wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\r\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\r\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\r\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\r\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\r\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\r\\nWith other Graces weigh\\'d\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\r\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp\\'rance, Stablenesse,\\r\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\r\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\r\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\r\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\r\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\r\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\r\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\r\\nAll vnity on earth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\r\\nI am as I haue spoken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\r\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\r\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\r\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\r\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\r\\nAnd do\\'s blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\r\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\r\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\r\\nDy\\'de euery day she liu\\'d. Fare thee well,\\r\\nThese Euils thou repeat\\'st vpon thy selfe,\\r\\nHath banish\\'d me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\r\\nThy hope ends heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\r\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\r\\nWip\\'d the blacke Scruples, reconcil\\'d my thoughts\\r\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\r\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\r\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\r\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\r\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\r\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\r\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\r\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\r\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\r\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\r\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\r\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\r\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\r\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\r\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\r\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\r\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\r\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\r\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\r\\nNow wee\\'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\r\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\r\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\r\\n\\'Tis hard to reconcile.\\r\\nEnter a Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\r\\nI pray you?\\r\\n  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules\\r\\nThat stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\\r\\nThe great assay of Art. But at his touch,\\r\\nSuch sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\\r\\nThey presently amend.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What\\'s the Disease he meanes?\\r\\n  Mal. Tis call\\'d the Euill.\\r\\nA most myraculous worke in this good King,\\r\\nWhich often since my heere remaine in England,\\r\\nI haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\\r\\nHimselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people\\r\\nAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,\\r\\nThe meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\\r\\nHanging a golden stampe about their neckes,\\r\\nPut on with holy Prayers, and \\'tis spoken\\r\\nTo the succeeding Royalty he leaues\\r\\nThe healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,\\r\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\r\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\r\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\r\\nEnter Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macd. See who comes heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\r\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\r\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\r\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\r\\nBe call\\'d our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\r\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\r\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\r\\nAre made, not mark\\'d: Where violent sorrow seemes\\r\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\r\\nIs there scarse ask\\'d for who, and good mens liues\\r\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\r\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. What\\'s the newest griefe?\\r\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\r\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. How do\\'s my Wife?\\r\\n  Rosse. Why well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And all my Children?\\r\\n  Rosse. Well too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. The Tyrant ha\\'s not batter\\'d at their peace?\\r\\n  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue \\'em\\r\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos\\'t?\\r\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\r\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\r\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\r\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\r\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\r\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\r\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\r\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Bee\\'t their comfort\\r\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\r\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\r\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\r\\nThat Christendome giues out\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\r\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\r\\nThat would be howl\\'d out in the desert ayre,\\r\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What concerne they,\\r\\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\r\\nDue to some single brest?\\r\\n  Rosse. No minde that\\'s honest\\r\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\r\\nPertaines to you alone\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\r\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\r\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\r\\nthat euer yet they heard\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz\\'d: your Wife, and Babes\\r\\nSauagely slaughter\\'d: To relate the manner\\r\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther\\'d Deere\\r\\nTo adde the death of you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\r\\nWhat man, ne\\'re pull your hat vpon your browes:\\r\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do\\'s not speake,\\r\\nWhispers the o\\'re-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My Children too?\\r\\n  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil\\'d too?\\r\\n  Rosse. I haue said\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Be comforted.\\r\\nLet\\'s make vs Med\\'cines of our great Reuenge,\\r\\nTo cure this deadly greefe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He ha\\'s no Children. All my pretty ones?\\r\\nDid you say All? Oh Hell-Kite!

I shall do so:\\r\\nBut I must also feele it as a man;\\r\\nI cannot but remember such things were\\r\\nThat were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,\\r\\nAnd would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,\\r\\nThey were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,\\r\\nNot for their owne demerits, but for mine\\r\\nFell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe\\r\\nConuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,\\r\\nAnd Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,\\r\\nCut short all intermission: Front to Front,\\r\\nBring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe\\r\\nWithin my Swords length set him, if he scape\\r\\nHeauen forgiue him too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. This time goes manly:\\r\\nCome go we to the King, our Power is ready,\\r\\nOur lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth\\r\\nIs ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue\\r\\nPut on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,\\r\\nThe Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Quintus.

When was it shee last\\r\\nwalk\\'d?\\r\\n  Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue\\r\\nseene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon\\r\\nher, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,\\r\\nwrite vpon\\'t, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne\\r\\nto bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at\\r\\nonce the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.\\r\\nIn this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other\\r\\nactuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard\\r\\nher say?\\r\\n  Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. You may to me, and \\'tis most meet you should\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent.

How came she by that light?\\r\\n  Gent. Why it stood by her: she ha\\'s light by her continually,\\r\\n\\'tis her command\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. You see her eyes are open\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. I, but their sense are shut\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. What is it she do\\'s now?\\r\\nLooke how she rubbes her hands\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent.

One: Two: Why\\r\\nthen \\'tis time to doo\\'t: Hell is murky. Fye, my Lord, fie,\\r\\na Souldier, and affear\\'d? what need we feare? who knowes\\r\\nit, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who\\r\\nwould haue thought the olde man to haue had so much\\r\\nblood in him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Do you marke that?\\r\\n  Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?\\r\\nWhat will these hands ne\\'re be cleane? No more o\\'that\\r\\nmy Lord, no more o\\'that: you marre all with this starting\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Go too, go too:\\r\\nYou haue knowne what you should not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. She ha\\'s spoke what shee should not, I am sure\\r\\nof that: Heauen knowes what she ha\\'s knowne\\r\\n\\r\\n   La.

The hart is sorely charg\\'d\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,\\r\\nfor the dignity of the whole body\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Well, well, well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. Pray God it be sir\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue\\r\\nknowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue\\r\\ndyed holily in their beds\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lad. Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,\\r\\nlooke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo\\'s buried;\\r\\nhe cannot come out on\\'s graue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Euen so?\\r\\n  Lady.

usually created from multiple editions,  all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a  copyright notice is included   Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any  of these books in

neither this list nor its contents are final till  midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement   The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at  Midnight, Central

will have to do, but we will try to see a  new copy has at least one byte more or less       Information about Project Gutenberg  one page     We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work   The  time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours  to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright  searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc   This  projected audience is one hundred million readers   If our value  per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce     million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty six text  files per month, or     more Etexts in      for a total of        If these reach just     of the computerized population, then the  total should reach over     billion Etexts given away this year     The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext  Files by December   ,           ,    x    ,   ,        Trillion   This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,  which is only     of the present number of computer users     At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one third  of that goal by the end of     , or about  ,    Etexts unless we  manage to get some real funding  currently our funding is mostly  from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie Mellon University, and an  assortment of sporadic gifts  this salary is only good for a few  more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we  don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person     We need your donations more than ever       All donations should be

      END             Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie of Macbeth            Executive Director's Notes     In addition to the notes below, and so you will  NOT  think all  the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have  been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they  are presented herein       Barnardo  Who's there     Fran  Nay answer me  Stand   vnfold  your selfe       Bar  Long liue the King           As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words  or letters they had often packed into a  cliche      this is the  original meaning of the term cliche     and thus, being unwilling  to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions  that look very odd     such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,  above     and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming  Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner           The answer is that they MAY have packed  liue  into a cliche at a  time when they were out of  v 's     possibly having used  vv  in  place of some  w 's, etc   This was a common practice of the day,  as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend  more on a wider selection of characters than they had to     You will find a lot of these kinds of  errors  in this text, as I  have mentioned in other times and places, many  scholars  have an  extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a  very high place in the  canon  of Shakespeare   My father read an  assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University  in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the  purpose   To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available       in great detail     and determined from the various changes,  that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a  variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in famous  for signing his name with several different spellings     So, please take this into account when reading the comments below  made by our volunteer who prepared this file   you may see errors  that are  not  errors           So     with this caveat     we have NOT changed the canon errors,  here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie  of Macbeth     Michael S  Hart  Project Gutenberg  Executive Director               Scanner's Notes  What this is and isn't   This was taken from  a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can  come in ASCII to the printed text     The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the  conjoined ae have been changed to ae   I have left the spelling,  punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the  printed text   I have corrected some spelling mistakes  I have put  together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the  Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified  spellings according to this template , typo's and expanded  abbreviations as I have come across them   Everything within  brackets    is what I have added   So if you don't like that  you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a  purer Shakespeare     Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual  differences between various copies of the first folio   So there may  be differences  other than what I have mentioned above  between  this and other first folio editions   This is due to the printer's  habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and  then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then  continuing the printing run   The proof run wasn't thrown away but  incorporated into the printed copies   This is just the way it is   The text I have used was a composite of more than    different  First Folio editions' best pages     If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation  errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel  free to email me those errors   I wish to make this the best  etext possible   My email address for right now are haradda aol com  and davidr inconnect com   I hope that you enjoy this     David Reed    The Tragedie of Macbeth
